# Publishing your app with GitHub pages (if you are not using Socket.io)

GitHub will serve contents of this folder at pages.github.ccs.neu.edu/cs7580su20-seattle/YOUR-REPO-NAME

To publish your app:

`cd` to your project directory

`npm run build`

Copy the contents of the build folder into this folder then copy and push your changes. You do not need to keep this file.

## If you are using Socket.io, you will need to use Heroku to host your project!
